- I luckily didn't find this assignment to be very difficult thanks to my prior use of UnitTest in SSW-555.

- The requirements for this assignment were interesting and helped with the learning process. It was helpful to purposefully add bugs to the code to learn more about the importance of testing.

- I did not encounter many issues with the tools besides making sure I had sufficient test cases.

- To ensure I had sufficient test cases I made sure to test every permutation of triangle types. This meant testing for both right and nonright angle varieties of scalene and isosceles triangles. I also tested for the case where the side lengths did not form a triangle. I also made sure to test for different ordering of the function parameters to ensure the code wasn't dependent on the hypotenuse being in a specific position.
